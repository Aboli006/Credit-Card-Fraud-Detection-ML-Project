# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-ML-Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud. Utilizing Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, and Decision Tree Classifier algorithms, the best result is achieved with Logistic Regression, attaining an accuracy of 0.978 and F1 score of 0.95. Additionally, a correlation heatmap and t-SNE visualization are used for feature analysis and data visualization.
